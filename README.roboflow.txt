The dataset includes 299 images.
Objects-MgBn are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between 0 and +1 percent
